# Gilfoyle Bot!!

A script that automatically reads your imessage history to create a finetuning jsonl, uses lora to finetune a LoRA model using your MPS chip, and then launches a server to automatically respond to your messages with the model!

just use `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv run python main.py --all` to run the bot!

Make sure your terminal has full disk access to chat.db
